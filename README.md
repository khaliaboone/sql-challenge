# SQL Challenge: Pewlett Hackard Employee Database

## Project Summary

In this assignment, I worked with historical employee data from Pewlett Hackard covering the 1980s and 1990s. The goal was to set up a SQL database and analyze the data.

## What You Did

1. **Data Modeling**:
   - Created a diagram to show how different pieces of employee data (like employees, departments, and salaries) are related.

2. **Data Engineering**:
   - Set up tables in a SQL database based on the provided CSV files.
   - Imported the data from these CSV files into the SQL tables.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Wrote SQL queries to answer specific questions, such as:
     - List all employees with their details.
     - Find employees hired in 1986.
     - Identify department managers and their details.
     - List employees in specific departments.
     - Count how many employees share the same last name.

## Outcome

- You successfully created and populated a SQL database.
- You ran queries to extract and analyze the employee data, providing valuable insights.

I acquired help from ChatGPT to formulate my answers as well as my codes that I have submitted. While sql code may not be perfect I enjoyed challenging myself to learn more about this assignment.
